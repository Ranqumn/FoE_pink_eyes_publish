Trigger Happy had been a guard for a good half of her life, and she was pretty sure she'd seen everything that could try to get through the Tunnel Town gates. Tonight, she had to admit that she had been wrong, but the fact that all her guards were cowering behind her because of a foal in a funny costume was even more upsetting.

``All right, scaredy-ponies, I'm taking this one. Just relax and, for the sake of my sorry tail, don't shoot blindly.''

She stepped out of the guard post and trotted toward the yellow foal who was surrounded by an eerie pink light. ``Okay, that's close enough. Stop right there and tell me what the hay you are!''

Trigger didn't actually expect the foal to comply, but when she sat down the guard chief felt relieved.

The strange pony rose its hoof and waved it at her. ``Hi! I'm Puppysmiles! Have you seen my mom?''

Trigger Happy frowned. ``Puppysmiles as in 'Puppysmiles the ghost'?''

``I'm not a ghost, I'm a filly!'' she protested. She was carrying something long and red strapped on her back. It didn't seem a weapon, but it was still quite large.

``Let me guess. You zoomed all the way here from Salt Cube City through the marshes on a Red Racer?''

Puppy giggled. ``Nope, I had to trot a bit because the fat unicorn was super boringly slow.''

``The who now? No wait! On a second thought, I don't care.'' Trigger sighed. ``Now I'm coming over. You just don't do anything, ah, ghostly.'' Trigger turned her head toward the guard post just to meet three pairs of eyes that were carefully hiding behind the barricade. One of her guards waved a little white banner for a second. She silently wished for a crew that was less stupid, then trotted toward Puppysmiles.

``Hi! You're pretty, miss pretty pony! What's your name?'' The foal smiled her friendliest smile.

\emph{It's\dots it's just a filly with a pair of glowing eyes, probably caused by a mild case of radiation poisoning.} Trigger chuckled. ``Are you serious? You're the Puppysmiles from the news? The one from the Carnival and Salt Cube City?'' She laughed. ``Oh please, gimme a break!''

Puppy smiled and laughed too. ``Ah ah ah! That's funny! Uh, why are we laughing?''

At Puppy's question the guard chief laughed even louder. ``Name's Trigger Happy, but you can call me Trigger.''

Puppy frowned. ``Ah, can I call you Happy?''

``Sure. Anyhow, I have something for you.'' Trigger took a yellow piece of plastic and handed it to Puppysmiles. ``Here's your pass. A griffon by the name of Henrietta was here at noon. She waited until dusk for you, but then she had to move. Before leaving, she bought you the ticket saying that you were arriving sometime tonight or tomorrow.''

``Uh, Henri was here? Was she all right?''

``Yes, I think. She wasn't very chatty, but I never met a chatty griffon.'' Trigger turned on her tail and trotted back to the guard post. ``Come in! Staying outside this late is unhealthy. We have some bloodwing issues 'round here.''

``What's a bloodwing?'' Puppy asked, trotting behind Trigger.

``If you ask me, they're trouble. Think of them as large flying leeches.'' She snickered and beckoned Puppy inside the guard post. It was a low building surrounded by sandbags and rusted plates of metal. A couple of miniguns were placed in front of the windows overlooking the bridge, and there was a stack of ammo boxes stashed in a corner. Three ponies greeted Puppy with scarce enthusiasm as she followed the mare inside.

``Look alive guys. This is Puppysmiles, the hero of the Carnival. As far as I know she's on our side, so we have nothing to fear.'' Trigger snickered. ``I'd give my cutie mark to see how Lonesome Pony would react if he knew what his \emph{'hero'} really looked like. Anyhow, this is Green Pear, Jammed Gun, and Little Bean.''

``Hi, I'm Puppysmiles!'' She trotted toward the trio of ponies. Since her new friends seemed a bit uneasy, she felt that something more had to be said. ``I'm looking for my mom, and she's somewhere inside the mountain!''

One of the three guards raised an eyebrow and mumbled, ``Well, that could be a problem.''

\englishdaytimeplace{6}{9:45 P.M.}{Tunnel Town, Big 52 N Branch}

``Wow, it's huge!'' Puppy sat in front of the tunnel entrance. It consisted of a large archway high enough to let in both ground carts and air wagons for emergencies or maintenance. The entrance was so wide it could have handled passage from both directions at once. The concrete of the tunnel walls ended abruptly twenty meters into the mountain, where a rusted metal bulkhead sealed it. On the door there was the symbol of a white alicorn, but this one seemed more bulky and manly than the goddesses. Around the symbol ran a motto: \emph{Solaris Inc. ‒ Try the alternative.} Under the company slogan there was a big red symbol, suggesting danger, that occupied most of the door.

``See?'' Trigger Happy knocked at the metal door a couple of times. ``It's sealed. I'm afraid that your journey ends here, little one.''

``But my mom is in there! Look at the arrow, see? It points to the door! I have to go inside the mountain! Open it please!'' Puppy put on her best pout. ``Puppy please, Miss Happy pretty pony?''

Trigger stepped back frowning. ``Wow, those eyes should be classified as illegal military ordinance! Still, I'm sorry, Puppy. There's no way inside the Tunnel. We have tried our best to reopen it, but, as you can see, it won't budge.''

``But I really, really, REALLY have to go there! My mom is waiting for me!'' She stubbornly stomped her hooves.

Jammed Gun tapped his chin with a hoof and muttered, ``I think that TNT once said something about getting inside using the vents.''

Trigger's eyes widened. ``Shush!'' She launched an angry stare at her subordinate before quickly turning back to Puppy, trying to hide a concerned look under a fake smile.

``See? No way inside!'' She tried to hold a poker face, but Puppy was already frowning.

``Uh, vents? What are the vents? Please, I'll do anything. I-I have this!'' Puppy produced one of the tank shells from the military base. This one had a black band around its head. ``See? It's shiny and super duper nice! You let me go inside and I'll give it to you! Deal?''

``Puppy, it's dangerous. I can't let a foal trot to certain death! I'm sorry.''

Puppy stepped back, on the verge of tears. ``I'm not afraid and you're unfair! If it was your mom that was closed inside, you would already be opening that stoopid door! And\dots and---'' She bucked the door. ``I can't stop now! She is there, she \emph{must} be there!''

Jammed stepped next to Trigger and whispered, ``Why not let her in? After all, she's already saved two towns! Besides, I don't think she's just a foal.''

Trigger sighed before she replied. ``We don't know what's going on inside the Tunnel right now, but I'd like you to recall the day the door closed. I clearly remember the ponies trapped inside hitting the door and asking for help, the sound of the guns, and the voices screaming in pain and terror.'' Trigger softly bumped Jammed's forehead with a hoof. ``Look at her. Maybe she's not your average little pony, but she's still just a kid. I'm not sending kids to clear minefields.''

Jammed looked into his chief's eyes. ``Do you think that she'll give up that easy? If she really is the famous ghost, I don't think there's anything we can do to stop her.''

Trigger Happy facehoofed. ``Are you really falling for those fairy tales? Please, get real! She's just a filly with a full enviromental suit and mild radiation poisoning!''

In the meantime, Puppy was still standing in front of the door, muttering to herself. ``I'm not a foal, I'm a big pony! I've made a balloon fly!'' She frowned angrily at Trigger Happy. Suddenly, a new idea popped into her head, making her smile cunningly. ``Say, Mister Voice, what is this vent they are talking about?''

{\mt ``Vent: ventilation system. Device used to circulate fresh air inside close spaces. In the case of a tunnel it consists of a long web of passages that take air from the outside and pump it inside using fans and small ducts large enough to let a single pony crawl through them for maintenance--the more you know!''}

``So, ah, there are other doors to go inside the mountain from where the air gets in?'' asked Puppy, trying to translate what she was just told.

{\mt ``Affirmative. Loading local maps. Solaris Inc. Tunnel n° 2. Analyzing technical blueprints. Warning. Part of the blueprints are not available due to military restrictions. Loading section A01, A02, and A03. Loading maintenance tunnels blueprints. Analyzing. Elaborating route. Maintenance hatch A01-104 set as new waypoint.''}

The pink arrow disappeared from the compass and appeared again pointing to a new direction.

A grin appeared on Puppy's muzzle. Once again she had outsmarted her rivals.

\englishdaytimeplace{6}{10:15 P.M.}{Tunnel Town, Big 52 N Branch}

``And I'm saying that I've never seen a pony survive inside a sealed suit for more than three days! Your 'kid' seems just a bit too fine to be normal!'' Jammed Gun pointed a hoof at the empty place where Puppy was supposed to be. He did a double take, looking at where he was pointing and realizing that something was missing. Something the size, shape, and color of Puppysmiles. ``What the hay?''

Trigger Happy jumped on her hooves, looking around frantically. ``She was here a minute ago! Why didn't you keep an eye on that filly?''

``Oh, now \emph{I} have to watch after the glowing, yellow pony? And what were you supposed to do?'' Jammed stopped and snickered. ``See? It's just like I was saying, you can't stop the Ghost of the Big 52.''

``She's not a ghost, so stop blabbering.'' Trigger Happy waved a hoof, dismissing the idea, but her companion continued talking.

``Now please, Happy, listen to me for a moment. This place is getting worse every day. When we were kids we used to play outside, and the Big 52 had way less slavers and bandits. The tribes were strong enough to keep order and make everypony feel a little safe.'' He sighed. ``Don't you miss those days, Happy?''

She looked down, sadness filling her eyes with a dim shadow of tears. ``Yeah, but at that time it was easier. The tunnel was still open, and Sun City was a civilized place. Now the Big 52 is just a bunch of detours and dangerous trails.''

``Yeah, I know\dots so I was wondering. They say that everything has a spirit, right?'' Jammed Gun was trying hard to explain a thing that was quite clear in his head, but not that easy to put down in words. ``It's like a city. A city is more than the ponies that live in it. The efforts of the community and the hopes of the families sustain each other, feeding a common will that makes you feel as if the whole place is alive.''

``Yeah, it's called community. So what?'' Happy looked at Jammed with a dubious expression. ``I hope you're really going somewhere with this, because we have a lost filly right now!''

``So, even the Big 52 is something like that, right? I mean, The Redtrotters, the White Apples, the Sand Sweepers, and all the other tribes. Maybe they're separated, but they all live on the same long route from the Ridges to Emerald Shores. We are all on the same road, and we all are citizens of the Big 52.'' Jammed Gun raised a hoof pointing north, then arched to the south with a slow movement. ``Salt Cube City belongs to the White Apples, yes, but the Big 52 belongs to everypony that lives along it.''

``This is a very poetic idea, but I still don't see how this is going to help us find Puppy.''

``I'm almost there. We both had that feeling. You know, that the Big 52 is dying. Slowly but inexorably sliding into the same horrors as the rest of Equestria. And suddenly\dots bang! This Ghost appears and starts solving problems that vexed us for years.''

``The Redtrotters were slowly giving up. The Carnival was killing more than a foal per year. It was killing hope. Once I heard a trader say that the mares of the tribe refused to have foals because they were scared to lose them. And the ghouls? Do you know how many caravans traveled only as far as Exchange Station Badlands because making the trip to Downtown wasn't worth the additional escort?''

``Well, yes, okay, but I don't think that a foal can---'' 

``And I think she can.'' Jammed was dead serious. ``Think about that griffon today. Have you seen her eyes? She had this\dots light. As if things for her had sucked for a lifetime, but finally they were beginning to get better. She had hope, and she showed gratitude. Think about this, Happy. How many ponies in this sinkhole value gratitude? Maybe several years ago it was still common to think of other ponies as something other than a potential threat, but nowadays if you don't have the pass you aren't even given a chance.'' Jammed paused for a moment, but now Trigger was listening carefully and didn't interrupt him.

``And now she needs to get into the Tunnel. Maybe she is just a lucky foal, or a dead one, but---but I want to believe that she's something more. Okay, maybe she's not the Stable Dweller, or Security, but she's all we got down here. Just the good old Big 52 trying to fix things by herself.''

Trigger Happy sighed. ``You are a dreamer and a silly pony, Jam. If you have a problem you can't just wait for somepony else to come and solve it for you. You have to face it and work hard in order to earn something.'' She looked away at the ever-clouded sky. ``But I have to admit that in one way, you're right. That filly doesn't know when to give up. I think I know where she's headed, and Luna curse my soul if I'm letting her wander into trouble.''

\englishdaytimeplace{6}{10:15 P.M.}{Solaris Tunnel, Tunnel Town}

A metallic sound echoed through the ventilation ducts. The whole place was pitch black except for the dim light from Puppy's eyes and the helmet's HUD. For her it was more than enough to see where she was going. After all, she was following the arrow. She couldn't be wrong!

``When I find Mom, I'm hugging her super strong. Then she'll kiss me and we will be together forever.'' She was reviewing the vital passages of her new plan. ``Because this time she didn't move away, right Mister Voice?''

{\mt ``Negative. There is a 99.9\% probability that your female parent will not be present or in condition to---''}

``Hey, don't even try that! A positive attitude is everything.'' Puppy stopped for a moment and looked around. She could've sworn she heard something. ``Hey, did you hear that? Like somepony calling?'' She took a deep breath. ``I'M HERE! WHERE ARE YOU?''

The sound of Puppy's voice echoed for a lifetime in the dark and lifeless tunnels before dying. A distant voice seemed to reply, but Puppy couldn't hear it very well.

``Where is this voice coming from?''

{\mt ``Analyzing. White noise and distortion are too high. Impossible to determine the source of origin.''}

``Oh well, then let's move.'' Trotting away, Puppy found herself looking down from a grate. Just below her there was a black and bottomless void ready to devour anything.

``Uh, why is the arrow pointing down now?''

{\mt ``Loading instructions. You need to reach the main tunnel ground level in order to proceed. Maintenance grate A01-001 is the nearest passage to reach the next section of the tunnel.''}


\horizonline

\englishdaytimeplace{6}{10:15 P.M.}{Tunnel Town, Big 52 N Branch}

``I don't give a fuck about your opinion, Jam! Now give me the light helmet and help me with that checklist.'' Trigger Happy was wearing a worn-out maintenance suit equipped with a wide variety of tools.

Jammed Gun sighed, trying to appear annoyed. It wasn't hard to sense that he was worried to death. ``As you wish, Happy, but please, come back\dots''

Trigger snorted and looked away. ``The list.''

The stallion sighed again and shook his head. ``Rope.''

``Check.''

``Batteries.''

``Check.''

``Canteen.''

``Check.''

``Shotgun and slugs.''

``Check, check.''

``Common sense.''

``Che---hey, stop playing around!''

Jammed Gun snapped, unable to conceal his feelings any longer. ``And you stop trying to kill yourself, Happy! You're a good shot and an action pony, but you're still a pony! You could get killed, and I don't want to lose you!''

She cocked her head. ``Lose me? What do you mean by that?''

``I mean that I love you, Trigger Happy! Since we were little more than foals! Why do you think I enrolled into the guards instead of keeping Pa's tavern? Please don't go\dots or at least let me come with you!''

Trigger tilted her head, frowning. ``You mean\dots you had a crush on me for, like, twelve years and never said a single word? Even when Black Hat and I---'' Trigger shook her head. ''You're kidding me. This is another fucking joke, isn't it?''

Jammed Gun sat down, lowering his eyes. ``I wish it was, but you can be really cruel sometimes. And I'm a shy guy, you know? But I can't just watch you kill yourself over a ghost.''

``She's not a ghost! Why must you be so stupid? She's a little foal, and she is in danger!'' Happy grimaced. ``Since she's not coming back, I'm going inside to get her, and I'll spank her so hard that she will never do something like this again!'' She paused for a moment. ``Oh, and I'm sorry, but after Black Hat, I'm more into fillies than colts. Uh, we should talk when I get back. Is the list done?''

Jammed's jaw fell open in shock. It took him a while to process what she'd said. Slowly, he regained his composure and nodded in her direction.

``Sweet, I'll be back soon.'' Trigger crawled inside the maintenance tunnel, disappearing into the darkness.

``Great. I got dumped. Twelve years to find the guts to spit it out, and I got dumped! Fuck, I'm out of here. Maybe Little Bean didn't finish that Wild Pegasus.'' He turned on his tail and walked away, stopping one last time only to whisper, ``Please, come back in one piece\dots''


\horizonline

\englishdaytimeplace{6}{10:30 P.M.}{Solaris Tunnel, Tunnel Town}

{\mt ``Warning. You are doing it wrong.''}

Puppy was jumping up and down on the ventilation grate. After a minute of this treatment it had begun to crack. A bolt detached from the frame and fell into the black nothingness underneath. ``Don't worry, when the grate falls I'll jump away super fast! What could ever go wrong? After all, I'm Space Captain AndromedaaAAH!''

\dots

\emph{THUD!}

\dots

\dots

``Owie.''

{\mt ``Repair spell activated.''}


\horizonline

\englishdaytimeplace{6}{10:30 P.M.}{Solaris Tunnel, Tunnel Town}

Trigger Happy slowly crawled down the maintenance tunnels, searching for some sign of Puppy's passage. She was quite sure that Puppy entered the tunnels from the same hatch she did, but that place was a hell of a labyrinth. Lucky for her, though, she had a stick of chalk and a decent light source.

Passing above a ventilation grate, the mare stopped to look down in the main tunnel fifteen meters below. The grate creaked dangerously under her weight, but held.

``Sweet mother of Luna.'' Right below Trigger, not far from the metal doors that separated the inner tunnel from the town, were piles of bones that had amassed on the ground. They were the only surviving remains of the more than two dozens ponies that had been corralled there and executed on the spot. It was horrible.

Trigger could still remember the day the doors closed. It was an ordinary day only ten years ago. She had just begun her career as a town guard and still had to take tunnel patrol duty, though of course she had already been through them many, many times before. The passage connected Tunnel Town with Trade Station Tunnel South. It was the only way to get past Sugartop Mountain besides the pass, which was dangerous on clear days and practically suicide when it rained. If you wanted to reach the northern branch of the Big 52 from the south, you had to trot six kilometers underground, and pay good caps for it.

Then, the doors slammed shut.

There were no warnings, nor signs that it was coming, and, worst of all, there seemed to be no reason. The thick, gigantic bulkheads simply fell from the ceiling and sealed the tunnel with all the ponies that were inside at that moment. For about an hour ponies on both sides of the doors tried to open them, but suddenly those inside started screaming and beating on the metal, begging to be let out. It was at that point that there came the gunshots. The roar of two dozen machine guns that put a stop to the screaming.

After that day, only silent darkness dwelt in the tunnel. At first a couple of adventurers tried to get inside and hack the doors, but they never came back. With time the ponies of Tunnel Town resigned to this turning of events and worked hard to make the pass a little safer. A lot of ponies died trying to exterminate the predator's nests along the path, and they built a couple of shacks on the trail, but the caravans today were less than a fifth of the ones that used to pass through when the Tunnel was open. Tunnel Town was slowly dying.

Those skeletons below were just the first victims of this senseless tragedy, and maybe they were also the lucky ones. At least their end was fast.

Suddenly the sound of machine guns echoed in the tunnel. Trigger rubbed her ears to be sure that she wasn't hallucinating, but the guns kept firing.

``Fuck. I'm too late.''

\emph{That poor filly. Why did Jammed have to make me lose so much time? If I had been faster Puppy could still be}---``Wait, why are they still firing?''

The machine guns were still roaring in the distance as if they were fighting something rather than simply slaughtering it. Maybe the foal found some shelter and the security turrets couldn't hit her. Maybe it wasn't too late! After all, as long as the guns fired, it meant that Puppy hadn't been killed.

Trigger took the screwdriver and the rope from her utility saddle. ``Hold on little one! Big sis is coming for you!''


\horizonline

\englishdaytimeplace{6}{10:45 P.M.}{Solaris Tunnel, Tunnel Town}

Puppy trotted toward an abandoned cart in the middle of the road. She tried sniffing it, but it was a bit difficult since she was wearing a helmet. ``This place is full of cool stuff like food, toys, and those noisy guns that everypony is carrying around these days. Maybe it's some sort of super big closet.'' Puppy shrugged. ``Oh well, let's find Mom.''

``STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!''

A boisterous voice echoed in the tunnel that made Puppy turn her head. ``Oh, hi there! I'm Puppysmiles!'' A robot as large as a pony in heavy armor stood in front of her. It had the Solaris Inc. brand on its flanks, and a couple of firearms attached to each side.

``SURRENDER NOW AND BE ANNIHILATED!''

% Puppy giggled. ``Silly robot, it's surrender \emph{or} be anni---any\dots eenie\dots whatever.''

Puppy giggled. ``Silly robot, it's surrender \emph{or} be anni---any\dots eenie\dots what-ever.''

% NOTE: force to break line

The robot opened fire, hitting the cart and Puppy with no less than a dozen projectiles. Now, a rapid fire gun uses small caliber bullets that have decent piercing power, but those are nothing special when it comes to dismembering things.

Puppy looked down at the holes in the suit as a thin thread of pink smoke snaked out into the air. ``Hey, I was using this space suit! Oh, I get it now. You're a bullybot!'' Raising a hoof, she stared at the machine. ``I don't like bullybots. Rock.''

The security bot sprayed another salvo of bullets at the filly who charged it with \emph{The Rock Of Destiny} floating at her side. When the guns stopped to reload, Puppy jumped at its head, tearing into its face plate with all her might. She was getting good at this hitting thing. In fact, after just three consecutive strikes in the same place, the glassy visor of the robot cracked, revealing its sensor bay, which was then destroyed in a single hit. The machine stopped functioning almost immediately.

``And stop bullying fillies, dumb robot!''

``STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!'' Another two sentinels opened fire at Puppy, though they were so far away that they mostly missed her.

``Moar bullies? Very well, I have something for you too, stoopid bullies!''

A hail of bullets almost tore away one of her hind legs, but with Puppy, almost wasn't good enough. The wound simply slowed her. ``Don't you know that I'm a nice filly and I always try to behave? You're making me not behave! I'm gonna get in trouble for this!'' With \emph{The Rock Of Destiny} in her hoof, she was already on the second robot, cracking its visor.

Three more sentinels arrived, emptying their barrels into the filly, but she was way smaller than the robots. Their friendly fire destroyed another machine with the sheer volume of bullets alone.

``Aren't you listening? Are you stoopid or what?'' Puppy jumped on another robot, springing off the carcass of her last victim. Tracers zipped through the air, and her, while the suit rang every sort of alarm. Puppy? She didn't care. She just kept going.

``Fillies are made of sugar!'' Landing on the robot's face, she hit the top of its head, piercing it with her weapon in just five strikes. In the meantime, one of the two remaining robots ran out of ammo.

``SPICE!'' Puppy put a hoof inside the hole she had made using \emph{The Rock Of Destiny} and pulled out all the cables and circuitry she could. Something in the robot crackled and sparkled as it emptied what was left of its magazines all over the place, destroying the remaining two sentinels before shutting down itself.

``AND!'' \emph{Clank.} ``EVERYTHING!'' \emph{Clank.} ``NICE!'' \emph{Clank.}

At last she found some time to breathe while the smoke of the burning wreckage dispersed a little, mixing itself with the pink gas that leaked from the holes in her suit. A pink goo dripped from the larger tears, evaporating as soon as it touched the ground and mixing again with the cloud around her. Her ears still rang with the sound of firearms.

The pink cloud as usual didn't dissolve, forming a thick curtain of smoke around her instead and slowly beginning to vanish only when the holes in the suit were mended. The repairing was almost done when a familiar voice called Puppy's name.

``Hold on Puppy! I'm almost there!'' The sound of galloping hooves echoed in the large gallery, and in the eerie pink light cast by her eyes, Trigger Happy's silhouette appeared.

``Hi, Miss Pretty Guard Pony! Did you fall from the ceiling too?''

Trigger ignored Puppy's question and rushed to her, hitting her on top of her helmet. ``You stupid, stupid\dots silly pony!'' Tears ran along Trigger's muzzle. ``You're alive, thank Celestia. I was so worried! Why did you run away?'' Happy hugged Puppy. ``Now, we need to go back to Tunnel Town, since your mom can't be here, see? There are just abandoned carts and one, two, three, four-five-six destroyed sentinel robots?''

Trigger blinked, a bit stumped. ``You just single hoofedly destroyed\dots six sentinels?''

``Uh, please don't tell mom?'' Puppy's eyes were two watery pink lights in the darkness. ``Puppy please?''

``Are you kidding me? How did you do that?'' She pointed at the carcasses. ``I mean, six sentinels and not a single scratch?''

Puppy showed Trigger \emph{The Rock Of Destiny.} ``Ah, they were bullying me. I told them to quit, but they had those noisy things and kept being mean. Mom doesn't want me to beat other ponies, so please when we find mom don't tell her!''

Trigger studied the damage on the robots. ``These three were shot, but the other three you \emph{actually} stoned to death.'' Happy stared at Puppy. ``What are you?''

She tilted her head, a bit perplexed. ``I'm Puppysmiles?''

``Please, give me a break! I heard the firefight from the tunnel's entrance. You can't just stand there unwounded and smiling like a---a ghost?'' Realization hit Trigger Happy like a ten-ton anvil. She wasn't an educated mare, but she had heard a lot of stories from the traders and their guards. ``You, you're a Canterlot Ghoul!''

``Uh, yes I'm from Canterlot. Actually from Clover Leaf Terrace, but even if it's downhill it's still Canterlot, you know?''

Happy backpedaled another couple of meters as she noticed the last ribbons of pink smoke vanishing in the dark air and suddenly felt very, very itchy. In a rush of panic she downed a healing potion in a single gulp and backed off even farther.

Puppy looked at the unicorn and frowned. ``Ah, is something wrong, Miss Happy pretty pony?''

``This---this is ridiculous. You shouldn't be here. You shouldn't be talking with me now!'' Trigger's eyes betrayed her fear. ``You're just a, a---''

\emph{A what? A monster? A walking dead? A ghost? Shut the fuck up, Happy, she's a kid. She talks like a kid and acts like a kid. I came all this way to save Puppysmiles, and I won't go back without this filly.}

Trigger found the courage to put on a smile for the perplexed filly. ``You're just a little lost, but I'm sure that I'll figure out a way to help you if we go back to town.''

``But I can't!'' Puppy stomped a hoof on the road. ``Mom is here, and the arrow says that I must keep trotting in that direction! Please don't take me back, I'm almost there! I, I \emph{need} my mom!''

``I\dots I don't know. If this is really so important for you, I guess that if you promise to be really cautious, then we could try to go a little further. There were some other destroyed sentinels along the tunnel, so maybe these were the last functioning ones.''

``Yay!'' Puppy jumped all around like a spring toy.


\horizonline

\englishdaytimeplace{6}{11:00 P.M.}{Solaris Tunnel, Tunnel Town}

{\mt ``Please state your identification code and personal password.''}

This had to be the mother of all the sentinels. It was at least as tall as three ponies, and had a payload of weapons that made the average steel ranger look like a toy. Hell, Trigger Happy couldn't even name some of the weapons that thing had.

``We should go back, Puppy.''

``No wait! I know this guessing game! It's a genie!'' The foal cleared her voice, ``FT\dots 0\dots 0\dots 1\dots 6\dots 5\dots RD\dots C\dots 1\dots G\dots A ''

There was a long pause. Trigger readied herself to grab Puppy and run like she'd never run before.

{\mt ``Please, state your pass code for this ID.''}

She smiled and declared merrily, ``Hi! I'm Puppysmiles!''

Without even waiting for a reply, Trigger hauled Puppy on her back and started running. ``Please holy Goddess of Acceleration, don't fail me now!''

``Weeeee!'' Puppy was not exactly sure of what was going on, but she was riding a pony, and riding a pony was always fun.

{\mt ``ID accepted. First Class Technician Rainy Days. Access to maintenance section granted. Please do not enter into red marked areas without a Solaris Pass Card.''}

Trigger abruptly stopped, nearly sending her passenger flying across the tunnel. Puppy grabbed Trigger's neck and the two ponies found themselves looking into each other's eyes. Puppy was smiling.

``That was fun, let's do it again! I like piggyback rides! Hey, why are you putting me down?''

She sighed, patting Puppy on the top of the helmet. ``Don't worry, I'll give you another ride, but now I guess that the sentry is letting us go inside.''

``Well, \emph{duh}, sure! I said the magic words!'' Puppy trotted to the metal doors behind the towering robot and tried pushing them. As soon as she touched the metal, the reinforced doors slid open, revealing a corridor lit with dim, flickering lights. A distant voice repeated a long sequence of emergencies in a dull tone.

{\mt ``Warning. Primary power source cut off. Emergency shutdown procedure engaged. Warning. Intruders between sectors A01 and A03. Warning. Security robots not responding. Warning. Comm Station offline. Warning.''}

Puppy sighed. ``Aw, another whinybot.''

``Come again?'' Trigger tilted her head.

``You know. Whinybots.'' The blank stare from Trigger made Puppy sigh. ``I really have to teach you everything! There are three types of robots. Funbots, they are friendly and funny, like Miss Voice or Questioner. Then there are bullybots that are nasty and not so funny. Usually I have to break those ones and I really, really hope that Mom won't spank me for this. And there are whinybots. They can only whine because everything is wrong, like Mister Voice and---''

{\mt ``Negative. I am not whinybot, I am an advanced pony-machine interface designed for---''}

``Yeah, sure, I was talking with Happy, could you please wait a moment?'' The voice from the suit stopped while Trigger Happy stared at Puppy in disbelief.

``You\dots you're wearing a talking suit?''

``Yeah, and he's smart, but don't even try that joke smarter than you and then I say yes and then you laugh!''

Trigger frowned. ``Hey, what kind of pony do you think I am? I was just surprised, that's all.''

``Uh, okie dokie then. This is a super smart space suit that talks and tells me where my mom is. I follow him and usually find a lot of friends and some not-so-friendly ponies, but we still have to find Mom. Maybe this time we'll be lucky. Oh yeah, his name is Mister Voice.'' Puppy smiled, waiting for her reaction.

Trigger nodded weakly. ``Uh, yeah, whatever. So, that thing works more or less like a very large PipBuck. I guess this explains a lot of things, like how the hay you knew where the ventilation hatch was.'' She sighed before continuing. ``All right, little one. Where to now?''

Long story short, it took a little over an hour for the two ponies to reach an old rusted generator room and make the geothermal turbines run again. Luckily for them, restarting the turbines was just a matter of reconnecting cables that had been cut by a fallen steel beam. With some salvaging and jury rigging, mostly done by Trigger Happy, the electricity was now running along the cables again.

``Okay, let's see. Yes, the elevator is working again. We can go up.'' Trigger cleaned the sweat from her face and pushed open the elevator doors.

``Yay! I'm going to see Mom! Thank you thank you thank you so much, Miss Happy!''

She smiled weakly. She didn't believe that Puppy's mother really was somewhere near this place, but she was proved wrong so many times today. \emph{Maybe a little positive thinking is just what we need after all.} ``Good, we just have to hit the attic and see for ourselves.''

The elevator ran for more than a minute, tormenting the two passengers with lousy music that made Happy regret restarting the generators. When the doors opened again, there was a room with a whole wall made up of windows and large screens everywhere. It was the tunnel maintenance control room, and it hung above Sugartop mountain from a panoramic position that let Trigger see all the northern plains, even in the darkness of the ever-clouded night.

Puppy trotted around for a bit. It wasn't a very large place, but it had a lot of metal tables with terminals on them, as well as large maneframes stuck in a wall that could have actually hidden a crouched pony. The room was clearly empty and Trigger wasn't completely sure that just calling Mom louder was going to make her magically appear.

``Puppy, I\dots I don't think she's here.''

Puppy turned her head toward Trigger, and for a moment she felt a block of ice paralyzing her guts. Those eyes. So angry, so desperate, so\dots empty. It lasted for just a moment, but now she knew exactly how Puppy had been able to overcome six sentinels with a rock. \emph{Never cross her if you value your life.} ``Uh, I mean, maybe she moved away?''

Puppy lowered her eyes and sighed. ``Yeah, maybe. Last time she left some voice thingie that said she was coming here. Miss Voice could help a little with that.'' Puppy was now trying to smile again. That little ghost was full of anger, but she fought it with optimism. \emph{How long will this last? How long before she loses hope? And what will happen then?} ``Mister Voice, we need a professional. Call Miss Voice.''
