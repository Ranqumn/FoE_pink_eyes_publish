Transequestrian Route 52, also known as the Big 52, was slowly withering. From Salt Cube City to Emerald Shores, towns were becoming abandoned, slavers and raiders roamed where just a few years ago traders traveled safely, mysterious creatures haunted the north ridges, and the desert seemed to swallow whole even the most heavily armed groups of explorers. Nopony was willing to save the present while dangers continued to surface from the past.

\chapter{简介}

\pagestyle{chinese}

小马国52号公路，也就是52号国道，正在渐渐衰败着。从盐块城到翡翠海岸的那一段，一座座城市变成了空城，几年前商旅队还能安全穿行的地方现在游荡着奴隶贩子和强盗。北边的山岳里神秘的生物若隐若现，沙漠似乎在吞噬着哪怕是装备最齐全的探险队。以前埋下的祸根此时正纷纷破土而出，但没有小马愿意拯救这一切。

是时候迎来我们的英雄了。
